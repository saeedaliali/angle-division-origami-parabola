## 🔍 Features
-   **Hybrid Visualization:** See the direct translation of origami-inspired proportions and parabolic geometry into a classical construction.
-   **Adaptive Process Demonstration:** Watch the core "adjustment" step in action, where the correct scale is found through direct geometric comparison—no numbers needed.
-   **Dynamic Control:** Interactively change both the target angle (**α**) and the number of divisions (**n**) to see the construction adapt in real-time.
-   **Step-by-Step Breakdown:** Toggle individual construction phases (e.g., "Finding the Scale," "Drawing Key Circles," "Final Intersection") to understand the logic behind each stage.
-   **Accuracy Highlight:** The model is built on the exact analytic equations from the research, demonstrating the method's theoretical precision.
